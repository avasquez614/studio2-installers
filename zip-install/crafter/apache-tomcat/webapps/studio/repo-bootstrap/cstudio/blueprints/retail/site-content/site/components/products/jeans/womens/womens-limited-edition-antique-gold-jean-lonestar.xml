	<body>&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg, at 89 the oldest &lt;a href="http://www.lautenberg.senate.gov/"&gt;member of the Senate&lt;/a&gt; and its only remaining veteran of World War II, told his staff of his decision and was to announce it formally on Friday in Paterson, N.J., where he grew up the son of poor immigrant parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is not the end of anything, but rather the beginning of a two-year mission to pass new gun safety laws, protect children from toxic chemicals and create more opportunities for working families in New Jersey,&amp;rdquo; the senator, a Democrat, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While I may not be seeking re-election, there is plenty of work to do before the end of this term, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep fighting as hard as ever for the people of New Jersey in the U.S. Senate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg&amp;rsquo;s decision to retire had been complicated by an open challenge by Mayor &lt;a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Cory Booker." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/cory_booker/index.html?inline=nyt-per"&gt;Cory A. Booker&lt;/a&gt; of Newark, a 43-year-old Democrat who has become popular through frequent television appearances and updates to 1.3 million followers on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg had already been leaning toward retirement but felt disrespected when Mr. Booker announced his intention to run for the seat in December, before the senator had a chance to announce his departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg, known as a brawler even in the no-gloves arena of New Jersey politics, was upset enough that he began talking of running again, tweaking Mr. Booker in public for not paying sufficient attention to his current job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senator&amp;rsquo;s office was tentatively planning to announce his retirement at the annual Congressional dinner of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce last month; when the day came, Mr. Lautenberg was not ready to do so. Now he becomes the latest long-serving senator to announce his departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg, who made his fortune after helping to found &lt;a href="http://www.adp.com/"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;, the huge payroll company, left the Senate once before, in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he hated retirement so much that he jumped at the chance to return the next year when the state&amp;rsquo;s Democratic Party was looking for someone to substitute on the ballot for Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who stepped aside facing an ethics investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Lautenberg counts as his biggest achievement the ban on smoking on airplanes, which set off a process that continued with governments&amp;rsquo; prohibitions of smoking in restaurants and other public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also led battles to lower to 0.08 percent the legal limit on blood-alcohol content; to raise the drinking age to 21; to force companies to disclose what chemicals they emit into the air and water; and to bar gun ownership by people convicted of domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, with Democrats back home struggling to get traction against the state&amp;rsquo;s popular Republican governor, Chris Christie, Mr. Lautenberg has taken it upon himself to stand in opposition to the governor, particularly on &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/gov_christie.html"&gt;Mr. Christie&amp;rsquo;s cancellation&lt;/a&gt; of a project to build another train tunnel under the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Christie noted his differences with Mr. Lautenberg but said: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve always respected him for his tenacity, devotion to the people of New Jersey and his love for and commitment to public service. I will always be grateful for his doggedness in fighting with me and the delegation to ensure Congressional passage of an &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/01/us_senate_50b_sandy_aid_packag.html"&gt;aid package&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a class="meta-classifier" title="More articles about Hurricane Sandy." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making public his decision to retire, Mr. Lautenberg made his presence known in the Senate again. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, had to keep the vote on the &lt;a class="meta-classifier" title="More articles about filibusters and debate curbs." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/filibusters_and_debate_curbs/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary open for more than 20 minutes as senators milled around the floor waiting for Mr. Lautenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he walked into the chamber alone, shouted an &amp;ldquo;aye&amp;rdquo; vote lustily, then shook hands and accepted the congratulations of fellow Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat who has also expressed interest in running for the Senate seat, recalled volunteering for Mr. Lautenberg&amp;rsquo;s first campaign in 1982. &amp;ldquo;He was this very successful businessperson who came from a relatively poor background, and all he cared about was allowing the American dream to continue,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Pallone said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Booker issued a statement calling Mr. Lautenberg &amp;ldquo;a strong model of leadership and service,&amp;rdquo; and saying the senator had been &amp;ldquo;an invaluable partner in so many of Newark&amp;rsquo;s recent accomplishments and successes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</body>
